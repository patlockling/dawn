We were not impressed with the taste, quality or convenience of meal kits or “finish at home” delivery services or mass manufactured ready-made meals. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Instead of wallowing in our sorrows (and drowning them with wine), we decided to take matters into our own hands and to set up an online marketplace that connects amazing restaurants to food-loving customers across NSW. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>We get excited about food accessibility! It’s our mission to bring incredible food to as many people as possible. This is why we created a service where you can order from multiple restaurants in the one order - food unlocked! <\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are chuffed to work with some of the best restaurants and chefs in Australia. It is a real privilege to empower our restaurant partners to reach new customers and to develop new lines of products and services. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>While we love leaving a strong impression on your taste buds, we definitely do not want to do the same on the environment! We work closely with our restaurant partners to assist them with producing packaging which is biodegradable, freezer, oven and microwave safe. Also, our restaurant partners focus on selling frozen meals, which reduces the risk of food wastage.<\/p>"
